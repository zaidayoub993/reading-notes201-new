# HTML Images
HTML Images Syntax
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
The src Attribute
The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

Note: When a web page loads; it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.
# CSS Colors
The <color> CSS data type represents a color in the sRGB color space. A <color> may also include an alpha-channel transparency value, indicating how the color should composite with its background.

A <color> can be defined in any of the following ways:

Using a keyword (such as blue or transparent)
Using the RGB cubic-coordinate system (via the #-hexadecimal or the rgb() and rgba() functional notations)
Using the HSL cylindrical-coordinate system (via the hsl() and hsla() functional notations)
# CSS Text Effects
CSS Text Overflow, Word Wrap, Line Breaking Rules, and Writing Modes
In this chapter you will learn about the following properties:

text-overflow
word-wrap
word-break
writing-mode
CSS Text Overflow
The CSS text-overflow property specifies how overflowed content that is not displayed should be signaled to the user.
CSS Word Wrapping
The CSS word-wrap property allows long words to be able to be broken and wrap onto the next line. 

If a word is too long to fit within an area, it expands outside:

This paragraph contains a very long word: thisisaveryveryveryveryveryverylongword. The long word will break and wrap to the next line.

The word-wrap property allows you to force the text to wrap - even if it means splitting it in the middle of a word:

This paragraph contains a very long word: thisisaveryveryveryveryveryverylongword. The long word will break and wrap to the next line.
