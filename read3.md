# lists
HTML offers web authors three ways for specifying lists of information. All lists must contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain −

<ul> − An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.

<ol> − An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items.

<dl> − A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary.

HTML Unordered Lists
An unordered list is a collection of related items that have no special order or sequence. This list is created by using HTML <ul> tag. Each item in the list is marked with a bullet.
# CSS Box Model
### The CSS Box Model
All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. 
Explanation of the different parts:

* Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
* Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
* Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
* Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

# Decisions and Loops
If statements - If a condition is true, then run the code in that block.
If...Else statements - If a condition is true, then run the code in that block. Otherwise, run the code in the else block.
For loops - Run the code in this block based on a set number of iteration. This is known.
While loops - Run the code in this block while a condition is true. The number of iterations is unknown.
need 6 relational operators for our condition:

(==) - equal to - Compares two items to see if they are equal
(!=) - not equal to - Compares two items to see if they are not equal
(>) - greater than - Compares the first item to see if it is greater than the second item
(<) - less than - Compares the first item to see if it is less than the second item
(>=) - greater than or equal to - Compares the first item to see if it is greater than or equal to the second item
(<=) - less than or equal to - Compares the first item to see if it is less than or equal to the second item
