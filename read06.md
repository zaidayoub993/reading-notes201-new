# JavaScript Object Literal
A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package. This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.
Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array literals, functions, and nested object literals.
Object Literal Syntax
Object literals are defined using the following syntax rules:
A colon separates property name[1] from value.
A comma separates each name-value pair from the next.
There should be no comma after the last name-value pair.[2]
If any of the syntax rules are broken, such as a missing comma or colon or curly brace, a JavaScript error will be triggered. Browser error messages are helpful in pointing out the general location of object literal syntax errors, but they will not necessarily be completely accurate in pointing out the nature of the error.
# Document Object Model(dom)
The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. Usually, that means JavaScript, although modeling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects are not part of the core JavaScript language, as such.

The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.

Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.
